# My DotFiles for Linux / Windows

This is my personalised Linux / Windows dotfiles.
This set of scripts helps to set up fresh installed Ubuntu based distribution.
It includes predefined aliases, functions, script for installation various CLI utilities and software.

Can't count how many times i had to reinstall Linux system :)
I was bored to installing all the things manually all over again, so i decided to make a shell script that could set-up system using few commands.
